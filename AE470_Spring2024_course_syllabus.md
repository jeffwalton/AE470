## Course Description

This course provides an overview of the fundamentals of orbital mechanics. Beginning from kinematics and rigid body dynamics, students are introduced to topics in orbital and attitude dynamics and control. In orbital dynamics and control, core topics covered include: the two-body problem, orbital motion, Keplerâ€™s Laws, orbital elements, orbital perturbations, orbital maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, and the restricted three-body problem. In attitude dynamics and control, core topics covered include: attitude stabilization, torques on a spacecraft, torque-free motion, spin and dual-spin stabilization, gravity-gradient stabilization, and active attitude control.

## Course Objectives

   CO1: Apply mathematical concepts from kinematics and rigid body dynamics to describe the position, attitude, and equations of motion of a rigid spacecraft, expressed in arbitrary reference frames.  

   CO2: Analytically solve problems in orbital dynamics and control, particularly with respect to two-body orbital motion, orbit determination, orbital maneuvers, orbital perturbations and interplanetary trajectories.  

   *CO3: Analytically solve problems in attitude dynamics and control, particularly with respect to attitude stabilization, disturbance torques, torque-free attitude motion, and active spacecraft attitude control.
